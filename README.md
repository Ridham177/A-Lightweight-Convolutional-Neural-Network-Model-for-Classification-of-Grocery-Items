# A-Lightweight-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Model-for-Classification-of-Grocery-Items

#### This repository is for the submission of CSC 492 Senior Project at Cal Poly SLO
#### The repo contains a train.ipynb file that can be used to train on the RPC dataset on kaggle. Note that train and test directories would need to be changed for the initialization of the classes if it is not run on kaggle
